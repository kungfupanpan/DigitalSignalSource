# DigitalSignalSource
it's digital signal source based FPGA.I wrote it in VerilogHDL and its principle is DDS.
It can product many kinds of waves,like sine wave,square wave,triangle wave and so on.
Using the key_T,you can switch between them.
what's more,this project can adjust the output wave's amplitude as well as frequence.
It also provide you some approaches to modulation such as AM and FM.
I'glad to see that this will help you.Would you like to star it for me in return? 
Thank you very much!
